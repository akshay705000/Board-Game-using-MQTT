    - To run first you need to start HiveMq 
    - then run activity.sh file by running following commands
    	- chmod +x activity.sh
    	- ./activity.sh
    	
    - In activity.sh file there is a script where all players running commands are present 
    - if you want to check test cases you need to change activity.sh file accordingly
   
   
   - I have given sample test case in tar file with the code 
   - NOTE : keep all players.txt files in a same directory where players.py and activity.sh files are present.
   - NOTE : The works perfectly fine in my system, but when i checked on assignment partners system(performace of that system was low) then        synchronization effects the game. In that increasing the sleep time at line number 121 of code to make it perfectly fine for low performing systems.
